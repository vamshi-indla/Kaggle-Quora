Andrew Ng, Founder of Coursera conducted a Machine Learning course. Below are the class notes taken after watching videos.

### Machine Learning Definition:
  Let computer learn perform a Task T for a peformance metric P and obtain an experience E, based on the available data.
  When a new data point arises, it performances the Task T, based on its historical Experience
  
  
### Types of Machine Learning
# Supervised Learning
  Ex: Classifying email as spam or not.
      Classifying handwritten digits
      Classifying Fraud/Not Fraud Txns and so on
      
      
# Unsupervised Learning
  Ex: We let computer cluster the data points on some similarity. Market Segmentation, Nearest Neighbourhood house prices
  
# Other types of Machine learning: Reinforcement learning (chess/checker), recommendation learning(Netflix video recommendation, 
Amazon product recommendation, Google ads)
 
# Class 3
## Supervised Learning: Examples are provided with question and answer and we let the computer learn.
### Regression Model: Goal is to predict the continous Dependent Variable
  Ex: Predict housing prices based on location, house features etc
### Classification Model: Goal is to predict the Discrete values
  Ex: Predict the lump as benign or malignant

### SVM (Support Vector Machine) is good at prediction, when it comes to dealing with lots and lots of features.

# Class 4
## Unsupervised Learning: We let the computer let group based on data
Examples: Market Segmentation, News grouping on Google, Genetics of similar people, Astronomical Data analysis

### Octave is good for rapid prototyping and then the models can be created in C++/Java environment.
