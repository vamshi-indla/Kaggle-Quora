Tensorflow for image classification.
  Features need not be handpicked
  TF can understand texture on images
  Its a neural network with input layer, hidden layers and output layer
  Refer codelabs for code of image classifier
  Model is already trained on INCEPTION, 1.2 M images
  Output produces probability of top 5 classes.
